**What is Flycore?**

· Flycore is a 90% complete blaster awaiting your
new shell, design, or integration! I’ve done all
the work on flywheel spacing, pusher
mechanisms, and even a complete magwell with
detent or release!

· The goal of Flycore is to allow designers new
and old to focus on creating exciting new
designs with a proven flywheel core that’s
simple to build and has compact geometry to
integrate
